    <P><B> PLEASANT HILL CITY COUNCIL MINUTES </B></P><P><B> February 25, 2014 </B></P><P> 1. CALL TO ORDER/ROLL CALL</P><P>Mayor Kurovski called the Pleasant Hill City Council meeting to order on February 25, 2014 at 6:30 p.m. in the City Council Chambers. PRESENT: Jeff Mullen, Dean Cooper, Barb Malone, Len Murray and Mayor Sara Kurovski. ABSENT: Mark Konrad.</P><P>2. APPROVAL OF THE AGENDA</P><P>MALONE/MURRAY moved to approve the agenda as presented. ROLL CALL: AYES: Mullen, Cooper, Malone, Murray. NAYS: None. Motion carried 4-0.</P><P>3. PRESENTATION</P><P>Zach Young of the Des Moines Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) spoke about the regional collaboration of The Tomorrow Plan including its goals of creating a resilient regional economy, improving the regions environmental health and access to the outdoors, furthering the health and well-being of all residents in the region, increasing regional cooperation and efficiency at all levels, and everyday stewards of doing one thing. Mr. Young emphasized this is a voluntary plan and serves as a resource for local planners. He said approximately six or seven city councils in the area have approved this plan as well as Polk County Board of Supervisors. MULLEN/MURRAY moved to approve Resolution #022514-01 Resolution of Support for The Tomorrow Plan. ROLL CALL: AYES: Cooper, Mullen, Malone, Murray. NAYS: None. Motion carried 4-0.</P><P>4. PUBLIC INPUT (5 MINUTES FOR ITEMS NOT ON THE AGENDA)</P><P>None.</P><P>5.

ROLL CALL: AYES: Mullen, Cooper, Malone, Murray. NAYS: None. Motion carried 4-0.</P><P>6. BUSINESS ITEMS</P><P>a. COOPER/MULLEN moved to approve Resolution 022514-04 Approval of Plans and Specifications for 2014 Storm Sewer Improvements Jacobs Crossing Outlot "X". Eric Cannon, City Engineer, said this is a small storm sewer project and was necessary to address drainage issues and erosion on the site. He said Snyder & Associates would solicit three competitive bids on the project. ROLL CALL: AYES: Mullen, Cooper, Malone, Murray. NAYS: None. Motion carried 4-0.</P><P>b. MURRAY/MALONE moved to approve Resolution 022514-05 Approval of Site Plan for Magellan. Steve Steward from Magellan explained the project and stated this is a proposal to build a twelve (12) million gallon tank adjacent to the two existing tanks they have constructed in the last eighteen (18) months. Ben Champ, Acting City Manager, said Magellan pays approximately one million dollars in property tax a year with $500,000 of that going to the SE Polk School District which makes a positive impact on the areas economy. Mr. Steward said Magellan is committed to investing in and enhancing this facility as well as bettering the community. ROLL CALL: AYES: Mullen, Cooper, Malone, Murray. NAYS: None. Motion carried 4-0.</P><P>c. MULLEN/MALONE moved to approve Resolution 022514-06 Approval of Plans and Specifications for 2014 Christie Lane Improvements and Setting Dates for the Receipt of Bids and Project Award. Mr. Cannon highlighted this project which includes reconstructing the entire roadway, construction of a cul-de-sac at the end of the street along with a parking lot to offer access to the Gaye Lea Wilson Trail, replacing the water main and moving it from the westside of the street to the eastside, lining the sanitary sewer, and new storm sewers along the street. He said this is a very involved project and has had two neighborhood meetings to discuss the project. Mr. Cannon said this project divides Christie Lane into three construction stages, starting at the north end of the street. He anticipates construction to begin on April 1st and last until November 1st. ROLL CALL: AYES: Mullen, Cooper, Malone, Murray. NAYS: None. Motion carried 4-0.</P><P>d. COOPER/MURRAY moved to approve the purchase and installation of a cemetery columbarium in Oakwood Cemetery. Mr. Champ stated the Council was supportive of this item during a budget workshop. He said the City would need to make a down-payment of $16,000 of $32,000 total to order this columbarium and the footing/grading work would be done by public works staff. Gary Patterson, Public Works Director, said this would be situated in Block 1 which is to the right of the main entrance on E. Oakwood Drive and one hundred-fifty (150) feet to the west of the driveway, just south of the sidewalk. He said this columbarium would be situated to the furthest south in this area, allowing other columbariums (possibly two or three) to be added to the north of it in the future. ROLL CALL: AYES: Mullen, Cooper, Malone, Murray. NAYS: None. Motion carried 4-0.</P><P>7. CLOSING COMMENTS</P><P>Councilmember Cooper thanked Mr. Champ for taking on additional duties while Don Sandor, City Manager, is recovering from his health issues.</P><P>Councilmember Malone said the Metro Waste Authority has increased the tipping fee $1 a ton for all facilities. There is a proposal to build a new transfer station near the salt storage facility in Grimes which will require a ten million dollar, twenty-year bond. Polk County has agreed to service the bond; however, pending legal review, this may need to be presented to local jurisdictions (city councils) involved in MWA for approval as well.</P><P>Mr. Champ said there would be no work session next week (March 4th). Des Moines Area Regional Transit (DART) is interested in making a presentation at a future work session, possibly March 18th. There may also be a work session on April 1st regarding the SE Connector and presented by the engineers who are working on the alignment of it. The topics of the work sessions could change depending upon the availability schedules of presenters.</P><P>Mr. Patterson wanted to make the elected officials aware that the public works salt and sand supplies are running low for the season; therefore, his staff is using the remaining supplies very sparingly - focusing more on intersections, curves, and hills. He said salt is still available at the mines in Kansas; however, the price has greatly increased and his budget is nearly exhausted for purchasing these commodities this fiscal year.</P><P>8. ADJOURNMENT</P><P>MALONE/COOPER moved to adjourn the meeting. ROLL CALL: AYES: Mullen, Cooper, Malone, Murray. NAYS: None. Motion carried 4-0. The meeting was adjourned at 7:06 p.m.</P><P>Sara Kurovski, Mayor</P><P>ATTEST:</P><P>Steven A.
