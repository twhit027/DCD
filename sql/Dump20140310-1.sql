Yard Waste Bag Supplier Agreement - Action for ApprovalRegular Agenda Items for Approval - Items 11 and 1211. Resolution 02-14-06 - Approval of 2014/2015 Strategic Business Plan - Action ItemMWAs Strategic Business Plan aligns with the organizations mission, vision, and core values and ensures an ongoing approach to address industry trends and the needs of our communities. The Plan addresses the following key elements/strategies: provide an organizational culture of continuous improvement based on the Environmental Management System (EMS) while emphasizing operational efficiencies and cost savings, provide additional recycling opportunities as markets emerge by laying the groundwork for integration of conversion technologies, take an approach to remain cost-effective by providing regional programs and services that are sustainable, address increased diversion and increased revenue opportunities where possible. MWA continually addresses todays needs while preparing for the future of the organization.Moved by Altoona, seconded by West Des Moines, to approve Resolution 02-14-06. Motion carried unanimously by voice vote.12. Resolution 02-14-07 - Approval of Metro Waste Authoritys Fiscal Year 2014/2015 Annual Budget - Action ItemMWAs FY 2014/2015 budget aligns with the strategic business plan. MWA is proposing a $1/ton increase for all waste types at all MWA facilities with the exception of the C&D waste stream, which will increase $.20/ton. No additional personnel will be added. MWA is self-funding and no per capita fees are charged, unlike other solid waste facilities and cities in Iowa that charge a per capita fee to help fund and support solid waste and recycling services and programs.The following key items in the budget include:Construction costs ($10 million) for The Metro Northwest Transfer Station; Operational costs are not expected until FY 2015/2016; Note: MWA is still working with Polk County on the GO Bond request. The bonding attorneys have informed us we may need to attain approval from each individual city for the GO Bond.Anticipated methane royalties from new gas-to-electricity plant at MPE; Note: The plant will be operational in March, and MWA will begin to receive the royalties (approximately $160,000) from the plant.Reduction in recycling revenue from recyclables to reflect current market conditions;Capital projects of $10,804,833;Cell development costs of $1,471,000; Note: Cash funds are set aside for cell development projects at the landfill.Gerd Clabaugh, Johnston, asked about the financial detail in the 2014/2015 budget summary that reflects the $1 increase in the tipping fee resulting in $1.1 million in extra revenue, and the total increase in cash at the end of the year of $2.5 million. Grant Johnson, CFO, explained the $1.1 million includes additional revenue and does not just reflect the $1 increase in the tipping fees. The $2.5 million is adding back depreciation and amortization. The last two pages of the budget address the future cash flow needs of the organization, and identify major projects such as the costs of operating the Northwest Transfer Station as well as additional capital costs for cell development that will have an impact on the budget process in the next five years. This fiscal year doesnt include the principle and interest repayments of the GO Bond, those dollars will be figured into future year budgets, which will have a significant impact on our cash flow. In FY 2015/2016 we are considering a $2 increase for commercial rates and a $1 rate increase for all other waste streams to sustain major capital projects. No increase is anticipated in FY 2017/2018.The Director explained by increasing compaction and saving airspace at the landfill will produce a significant cost savings to MWA, which will impact future budgets by reducing the amount of funds set aside for closure, post closure costs.Moved by West Des Moines, seconded by Altoona, to approve Resolution 02-14-07. Motion carried unanimously by voice vote.13. Metro Park East Landfill Operational Assessment Presentation - Jeff DworekJeff Dworek, director of operations, presented on the value of airspace utilization, how its measured, and why increased efficiencies at the landfill are important. Two ways to increase the airspace utilization density is by decreasing the volume taken up by the waste and cover material. We have learned since conducting the landfill operational assessment that going to a new technique called the pancake method can increase further efficiencies. Jeff reported on the benefits of implementing the pancake method, and discussed the recommended airspace utilization goal of 1,520 lbs/cy based on the landfill evaluation that will increase compaction at the landfill significantly. After evaluating the process of the recommended pancake technique, staff feels the recommendation of 1,520 lbs/cy airspace utilization is attainable.Jeff also provided an update on the Metro Park East landfill operational efficiency evaluation assessment conducted by Neal Bolton of Blue Ridge Services, Inc. The presentation centered on the findings and recommendations from the final outcome of the core assessment, and the recommended change to the pancake method of operation. Discussion was held on equipment utilization and equipment efficiencies at the landfill. Staff will be evaluating and planning improvements based on the core assessment findings and recommendations. They will also review the current soil management plan over the next three months. A future update will be provided to the Board.14.

You are notified that a Garnishment was issued based on a judgment against you and the Garnishment was served on US BANK VIA CERTIFIED MAIL, who admitted to be in possession of your property or indebted to you.2. You are further notified that to contest the Garnishment you must file a Motion to Quash, Answer of Exemption, or other appropriate pleading within 10 days from the date this Notice was served on you. Your motion, Answer, or pleading must explain why you think these funds are exempt from execution under state or federal law. Some examples of exempt funds may include social security benefits, public assistance, county assistance, veterans benefits, and unemployment compensation. These are examples only and not intended as a complete list. If you do not contest the Garnishment, a court order will be entered condemning the funds and the funds will be applied against the judgment.3. Any Motion to Quash, Answer, Affidavit of Exemption, or other pleading that you file to contest the Garnishment must be filed in the office of the Clerk of the District Court located at Des Moines. If you file to contest the Garnishment, the court may set a hearing, in which case you will be notified of the hearing. If the court sets a hearing, you should be ready to explain to the judge why you believe your property is exempt from the Garnishment.4. Iowa Code section 642.14 requires that you be told the exact language of Iowa Code section 630.3A. That section reads:At any time after the rendition of the judgment the court, upon application of the judgment creditor or the judgment debtor and upon notice to the adverse party as the court shall direct, shall conduct a hearing to determine the reasonably expected annual earnings of the judgment debtor for the current calendar year and the applicable limitation upon garnishment as provided in Section 642.21. The court shall also consider in the interest of justice whether a greater amount that provided in Section 642.21 shall be exempt from garnishment. In making the determination, the court shall consider the age, number and circumstances of the dependants of the debtor, existing federal poverty level guidelines, the debtors maintenance and support needs, the debtors other financial obligations, and any other relevant information. An order reducing the garnishment may be modified or vacated upon the application of a party to the court, notice to the adverse party, and a showing at a hearing of changed circumstances. An additional filing fee shall not be assessed for proceedings under this section.You may wish to consult a lawyer for advice as to the meaning of this notice.THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO COLLECT A DEBT AND ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED WILL BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.

On all projects without DBE goals, the contractor must show that affirmative action has been made to seek out and consider DBEs as potential subcontractors.Some projects may be listed in multiple proposals (as an individual project or part of a combined package of projects).
