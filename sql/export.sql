Public hearing to consider a conditional rezoning request from Park Place Investments No. II, LLC for property at 2385 3rd Avenue SW to rezone from R-5 (PUD) to Conditional R-3 (Multi-family Residential)</P><P>Mayor Conkling explained the owners, Park Place Investments No II, LLC, are proposing to sell the property to be developed as Traditions Childrens Center. They are requesting a rezoning for the property from R-5 (PUD) to Conditional R-3 (Multi-family Residential). The condition that staff has suggested and the owner has agreed to, is to limit any multi-family development to no more than 10 units per acre. The reason for the condition is so that if the property were to be redeveloped in the event the day care is sold, the surrounding neighbors would not be subject to a higher density than what was in place when they bought their homes.</P><P>Open Hearing at 6:38pm</P><P>Public Comment: Jon Gruber, 2209 Weatherstone Ct., requested that council wait on allowing any more development in this area until the impact is seen from the new apartment complexes being built. Council Member Dean OConnor explained this development is a child care center. Council Member Kyle Mertz asked for clarification on the conditional zoning. Community Development Director John Shaw explained the conditional zoning would keep the same density as the R-5. Engineer Keith Weggen, Civil Design Advantage, 3405 SE Crossroads, Grimes, representing Park Place Investments and Traditions Childrens Center shared the concept for the child care center. Director Fred Hollister, Eastern Polk County Regional Development, 119 2nd St. SE, spoke in favor of the development.</P><P>Closed Hearing at 6:44pm</P><P>7.

Service Requirements. The Company shall furnish reasonable, adequate and efficient gas service to the residents of the City and shall maintain its system in reasonable repair and working order and provide adequate facilities for such maintenance.

You are further notified that to contest the Garnishment you must file a Motion to Quash, Answer of Exemption, or other appropriate pleading within 10 days from the date this Notice was served on you. Your motion, Answer, or pleading must explain why you think these funds are exempt from execution under state or federal law. Some examples of exempt funds may include social security benefits, public assistance, county assistance, veterans benefits, and unemployment compensation. These are examples only and not intended as a complete list. If you do not contest the Garnishment, a court order will be entered condemning the funds and the funds will be applied against the judgment.</P><P>3. Any Motion to Quash, Answer, Affidavit of Exemption, or other pleading that you file to contest the Garnishment must be filed in the office of the Clerk of the District Court located at Des Moines. If you file to contest the Garnishment, the court may set a hearing, in which case you will be notified of the hearing. If the court sets a hearing, you should be ready to explain to the judge why you believe your property is exempt from the Garnishment.</P><P>4. Iowa Code section 642.14 requires that you be told the exact language of Iowa Code section 630.3A. That section reads:</P><P>At any time after the rendition of the judgment the court, upon application of the judgment creditor or the judgment debtor and upon notice to the adverse party as the court shall direct, shall conduct a hearing to determine the reasonably expected annual earnings of the judgment debtor for the current calendar year and the applicable limitation upon garnishment as provided in Section 642.21. The court shall also consider in the interest of justice whether a greater amount that provided in Section 642.21 shall be exempt from garnishment. In making the determination, the court shall consider the age, number and circumstances of the dependants of the debtor, existing federal poverty level guidelines, the debtors maintenance and support needs, the debtors other financial obligations, and any other relevant information. An order reducing the garnishment may be modified or vacated upon the application of a party to the court, notice to the adverse party, and a showing at a hearing of changed circumstances. An additional filing fee shall not be assessed for proceedings under this section.</P><P>You may wish to consult a lawyer for advice as to the meaning of this notice.</P><P>THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO COLLECT A DEBT AND ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED WILL BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.

City Manager, David Jones; Assistant City Manager, Paul Moritz; and Director of Administrative Services, Jennifer Sease were present. </P><P><B> A. Discussion of Planning & Building Proposed Fee Schedule </B></P><P> City Manager, David Jones, reviewed the proposed fee schedule with council advising that the fee structure has not been revised for many years. He also stated the proposed schedule provides for revenue diversification in the citys budget and that the proposed $350,000 revenue in the FY15 budget is based on these recommendations. </P><P><B> B. FY15 Outstanding Budget Issues </B></P><P> City Manager, David Jones, advised council the only outstanding budget issue that needs discussing is the proposed police staffing in the FY15 budget. He stated the budget currently is programmed with a maximum of four additional police officers, which includes two School Resource Officers (SROs). The school board will be making a decision on funding of the two SROs at their next board meeting scheduled for Monday evening, February 17th. If the school approves the two SROs, funding will included in their FY15 budget. Based on council authorization, commencement of the hiring of one police officer and the two SROs would commence in April, 2014 to coincide with the budget and the fourth would be authorized for hiring in April 2015. This would allow the hiring to coordinate with the Police Academy training schedule.</P><P>Following council discussion, it was the consensus, to hire one additional police officer, and the School Resource Officers (SROs), if, the school approves their budget for such but would also need additional statistical information regarding number of calls to which a police officer responds, timing of response, and the amount of time an officer is engaged in calls, before approving the fourth police officer as proposed. </P><P><B> C. FY15 Utility Fund Review </B></P><P> Jennifer Sease, Director of Administrative Services, reviewed the Water, Sewer and Storm Water Utility Funds with council, reporting that a 5% rate increase is proposed for the sewer fund but no rate increase for water or storm water. </P><P><B> D. FY15 Hotel/Motel Fund Review </B></P><P> Jennifer Sease, Director of Administrative Services, reviewed the hotel/motel fund allocations proposed for FY15. She advised council that a letter requesting $5,000 in FY15 was received from Ankeny Substance Abuse Project (ASAP). Because of the timing of the request, it was the consensus of council not to fund the request as requested for FY15 but possibly consider during the FY16 budget process. </P><P><B> E. DART Discussion </B></P><P> City Manager, David Jones, advised council that DART is proposing a 10 cent tax increase in their FY15 budget. He stated he and Mayor Lorenz have recently met with Polk County Supervisor, Steve Van Oort, who serves as the City of Ankeny representative on the DART commission. Steve indicated the proposed tax rate increase could be dialed down to 9 cents and possibly down to 8 cents. According to Supervisor Van Oort, the increase in tax rate is related to increase in services and the Affordable Health Care Act, which requires providing health insurance to all employees working 30 hours or more. Almost all DART drivers work close to 30 hours a week.</P><P>Following council discussion, it was consensus that the mayor provide a formal response during the budget hearing at the DART meeting scheduled for March 4th, advising that, in the future, the City of Ankeny would like more direct input during the budget process.</P><P>The planning session adjourned at 8:02 p.m. No official action took place during this planning session.</P><P>Published in the Des Moines Register on the 21st day of February, 2014. </P>\n  '),
